# Module 2: Managing Office 365 users and groups
# Lab A: Managing Office 365 users and passwords
  
### Scenario
  
After configuring an Office 365 tenant and preparing it for pilot deployment, you are now ready to start creating user and group accounts in Office 365. You and your team need to be familiar with how to configure these accounts by using the Office 365 admin center because this will be your primary tool for managing the environment after the deployment is fully functional. Additionally, you need to make sure that the password policy for Office 365 users matches the password policy for on-premises users.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage Office 365 users and licenses by using the Office 365 admin center.

- Manage Office 365 password policies.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated Time: 35 minutes

User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator** for LON-DC1 and **Adatum\\Beth** for LON-CL1

Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

 In all of the tasks:

- Where you see references to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **_Adatumyyxxxxx_** with your unique Office 365 name that displays on the online lab portal.
- Where you see references to  **Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, replace the  **_Adatumyyxxxxx_** with your unique hostdomain.com name that displays on the online lab portal.


This lab requires the following virtual machines (use only the virtual machines required for your lab):

- LON-DC1:

  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- LON-CL1:

  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Beth** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

# Lab B: Managing Office 365 groups and administration
  
### Scenario
  
In addition to creating user accounts, you also need to know how to create group accounts in Office 365. In this pilot project, you will use Windows PowerShell commands to manage users and groups. If the pilot is successful, you can manage several hundred users and groups, and Windows PowerShell will be a means to manage them efficiently. One of the goals in the pilot project is to test delegated administration in Office 365, so you also need to delegate password management and billing management to different users.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Manage Office 365 groups by using the Office 365 admin center.
- Manage Office 365 users and groups by using Windows PowerShell.
- Configure delegated administrators.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.
