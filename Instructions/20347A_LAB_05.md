# Module 5: Planning and deploying Office 365 ProPlus
# Lab: Managing Office 365 ProPlus installations
  
### Scenario
  
Most users in your organization are using Office 2013 on their desktops. As part of the Office 365 pilot project, you would like to upgrade the clients to Office 365 ProPlus to take advantage of the new features available in Office 2016. 

The project steering committee has not yet decided whether they will allow users to install Office 365 ProPlus, or whether they will use a centralized installation mechanism. As part of the pilot project, you need to evaluate each option for deploying and managing Office 365 ProPlus.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Prepare an Office 365 ProPlus managed installation.
- Manage user-driven Office 365 ProPlus installations.
- Manage centralized Office 365 ProPlus installations.

  >  **Note**: The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup

## Exercise 1: Preparing an Office 365 ProPlus managed installation
  
### Scenario
  
One of the Office 365 ProPlus installation options that you are evaluating is using a managed deployment. To start, you will download and install the Office Deployment Tool, and start the download for Office 365 ProPlus. You will modify the installation to install and provide updates to use the Targeted (early semi-annual) channel.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Download the Office 365 deployment tool

2. Modify Office 365 ProPlus installation settings


#### Task 1: Download the Office 365 deployment tool

1. On  **LON-CL1**, on the taskbar, select  **File Explorer**.

2. In  **File Explorer**, select  **Local Disk (C:)** in the left navigation pane

3. In  **File Explorer**, select the  **Home** tab, and then select **New Folder**.

4. Type  **Office16**, and then press Enter.

5. In  **File Explorer**, right-click  **Office16**, select  **Give access to**, and then select  **Specific people...**.

6. In the  **Network access** dialog box, select the drop-down list box, select **Everyone** from the list, select **Add**, and then select  **Share**.

7. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, enter the following values and select **Yes**:
    - User name: **Administrator**
    - Password: **Pa55w.rd** 

8. In the  **Network access** dialog box, select **Done**.

12. In the  **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left panel, select  **Settings**, select  **Services & add-ins**, then select **Office software download settings**.

13. On the **Office software download settings** page scroll down to **How often do you want users to get feature updates for Office 2016 apps?** 

    > Note that you can choose for users to receive updates as often as they are made available (monthly) or the default of every six months.

14. Scroll up and select **Manually deploy user software**.

15. Under the  **Manually deploy user software** area, select **Learn how to download and deploy software**.

16. On the **Manage user software in Office 365** page, scroll down to the **Manually download and install the Office apps by using the Office Deployment Tool** section and select the **Microsoft Download Center** link to open the Office Deployment Tool download page.

23. In the **Browse For Folder** dialog box, expand **This PC**, expand **Local Disk (C:)**, and select the **Office16** folder.

24. Select  **OK**. You should see a notice that the files were extracted successfully. Select  **OK**, and then close the **Download Center** tab.

25. Navigate to the  **Office16** folder with File Explorer. You should see four files in the folder:

  - **configuration-Office365-x64.xml** - An example Office 365 client configuration file. The sample allows you to download and install the 64 bit version of the Office 365 ProPlus apps and Visio Pro for Office 365 directly from the Office CDN using the Monthly Channel.
  - **configuration-Office365-x86.xml** - An example Office 365 client configuration file. The sample allows you to download and install the 32 bit version of the Office 365 ProPlus apps and Visio Pro for Office 365 directly from the Office CDN using the Monthly Channel.

#### Task 2: Modify Office 365 ProPlus installation settings
  
1. In this step, you will back up the Office 16  **configuration-Office365-x86.xml** file and then open it so that you can edit it in the next step. To do this, perform the following steps:

    a. (If required), in  **File Explorer**, open the  **C:\\Office16** folder. 

    b. Right-click **configuration-Office365-x86.xml**, and select  **Copy**. Right-click again in the white space below the file list and select  **Paste**. 

    c. Right-click the  **configuration-Office365-x86.xml** file, select **Rename**, and change the name to:  **Adatumconfiguration-Office365-x86.xml**. 

    d. Right-click the **Adatumconfiguration-Office365-x86.xml** file, select **Open with**, and then select **Notepad**.

2. In  **Notepad**, edit the first **Add** line after **&lt;Configuration&gt;** to read: 

    ```
    <Add SourcePath="\\LON-CL1\\Office16\" OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Targeted">
    ```

3. In  **Notepad**, edit the **&lt;!--  &lt;Updates Enabled="TRUE" Channel="Monthly" /&gt;  --&gt;** line (by removing the **&lt;!--** and **--&gt;** comment tags) to read:

    ```

    ```
    <Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />
    ```

5. Comment out Microsoft Visio with the  **&lt;!--** and **--&gt;** codes to make the download quicker, by replacing this code:

    ```
    </Product>
    <Product ID="VisioProRetail">
    <Language ID="en-us" />
    </Product>
    ```

    with this code:

    ```
    </Product>
    <!--
    <Product ID="VisioProRetail">
    <Language ID="en-us" />
    </Product>
    -->
    ```

6. In **Notepad**, select **File**, then select **Save**.

7. Right-click **Start** and select **Command prompt**.

11. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```
    setup.exe /download \\LON-CL1\Office16\Adatumconfiguration-Office365-x86.xml
    ```

12. If the **User Account Control** window appear, select **Yes**.

13. Switch to File Explorer, and verify that the download has started. (A new folder named "**Office**" should be present in the **C:\\Office16** folder.) The download will take several minutes to complete. You can continue with the next task and leave the download in the background.


>  **Result**: You will have downloaded a copy of the Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus install for managed deployment to a shared folder. You will also download and install the Office Deployment Tool on the same machine.




## Exercise 2: Managing user-driven Office 365 ProPlus installations
  
### Scenario
  
As part of the pilot project, you need to understand the process of installing Office 365 ProPlus directly from the Office 365 portal. You must also explore options for managing the installation. A. Datum Corporation plans to use a combination of user-driven and managed deployments, depending on the employment relationship and working practices of individual users. Associates, those who have brought their own devices, and remote employees will all install Office 365 ProPlus manually from the Office 365 website. Beth, the administrator, will then determine what happens to users when she activates and deactivates Office 365 ProPlus subscriptions. She will also explore the different ways licensing effects the user.
