# Module 12: Monitoring and troubleshooting Microsoft Office 365
# Lab: Monitoring and troubleshooting Office 365
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum Corporation's Office 365 deployment is almost complete. As the team enters the final phase of this project, you need to set up a suitable monitoring environment to track the status of Office 365 and to ensure that the help desk and IT management can respond to any reported issues. Additionally, you need to learn how to monitor and troubleshoot Office 365 issues so that you can train the support staff in these areas.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Analyze mail flow using Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer.
- Analyze mail flow using Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365.
- View Office 365 usage report.
- View Office 365 Security & Compliance reports.


>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have used the Message Header Analyzer to identify why email failed to deliver, used the upport and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 to analyze the mail flow for an email message that (appeared) it was not received, and analyzed mail flow in the Exchange admin center.


## Exercise 2: Monitoring service health and analyzing reports
  
### Scenario
  
You identified the reports that you need to provide to A. Datum's management. Management is particularly interested in the number of malware and spam items that are reaching the organization.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand  **Reports** and select **Usage**, 

2. Select **Select a report** and under **Exchange**, select **Email activity**.

    >  **Note:** There might be little or no data shown because there is not much mailbox usage in the lab environment.
