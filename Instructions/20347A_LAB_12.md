# Module 12: Monitoring and troubleshooting Microsoft Office 365
# Lab: Monitoring and troubleshooting Office 365
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum Corporation's Office 365 deployment is almost complete. As the team enters the final phase of this project, you need to set up a suitable monitoring environment to track the status of Office 365 and to ensure that the help desk and IT management can respond to any reported issues. Additionally, you need to learn how to monitor and troubleshoot Office 365 issues so that you can train the support staff in these areas.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Analyze mail flow using Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer.
- Analyze mail flow using Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365.
- View Office 365 usage report.
- View Office 365 Security & Compliance reports.


>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated Time: 30 minutes 

Virtual machine:  **20347A-LON-DC1, 20347A-LON-DS1, and 20347A-LON-CL1**

 User name:  **Adatum\\administrator, Adatum\\Beth**

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

In all of the tasks:

- Where you see references to "Adatum _yyxxxxx_.onmicrosoft.com", replace "Adatum _yyxxxxx_" with your unique Office 365 name that displays in the online lab portal.
- Where you see references to "Adatum _yyxxxxx_.hostdomain.com", replace "Adatum _yyxxxxx_" ****with your unique hostdomain.com name that displays in the online lab portal.


This lab requires the following virtual machines: 

- LON-DC1:
  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

- LON-DS1:
  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

  - Sign in as  **Adatum\\Beth** by using the password **Pa55w.rd**.



## Exercise 1: Monitoring Office 365
  
### Scenario
  
Some A. Datum users report that they cannot access their mailboxes through Outlook. You need to check whether the issue is with client connectivity or with mail flow.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Send an email to a nonexistent domain
2. Track mail delivery using Remote Connectivity Analyzer
3. Send an email to a nonexistent user
4. Track mail delivery using Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365
5. Analyze mail flow



#### Task 1: Send an email to a nonexistent domain
  
1. Sign in to the Office 365 admin portal as  **Beth@Adatumyyxxxxxx.hostdomain.com** by using the password you created in Module 1.

2. Go to Outlook on the web, and then create an email to  **user@alt.none** with any subject and body text.

3. Send the email.



#### Task 2: Track mail delivery
  
1. Review the failed delivery report with the reason "The domain name in the email address is incorrect".

2. In the body of the message, select **...* to **Show message history**.

3. Below the text **Diagnostic information for administrators:**, select the text including the phrase "**Generating server**" down to "**X-OriginatorOrg: adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**" and then press Ctrl+C to copy it to the Clipboard.

4. Browse to  **testconnectivity.microsoft.com**.

<<<<<<< HEAD
4. Select the  **Message Analyzer** tab, paste the content, and then select **Analyze** **headers**.
=======
5. Select the  **Message Analyzer** tab, paste the content, and then select **Analyze** **headers**.
>>>>>>> 564fac958c055fa078a71c9b7d1045dffc25797e

6. Note the diagnostic information and the time taken for the message to be rejected.



#### Task 3: Send an email to a nonexistent user
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Send an email from Beth to  **difflop48999@outlook.com**.
=======
- Send an email from Beth to  **x154b2r56@outlook.com**.
>>>>>>> 564fac958c055fa078a71c9b7d1045dffc25797e



#### Task 4: Track mail delivery
  
1. Start Outlook 2016.
2. Download and install the **Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365** from **https://diagnostics.outlook.com/**.
3. In the Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365, analyze the mail flow for the message sent to **x154b2r56@outlook.com**.


#### Task 5: Analyze mail flow
  
1. Go to the Office 365 admin center, access the Exchange admin center, select  **mail flow**, and then select  **message trace**.

2. Add Beth as a sender.

3. Under Date range, select  **Past 24 hours**.

4. Under Delivery status, select  **Failed**, and then select  **Search**. Note the two messages.

5. Note the differences between the message processing events: Receive, Submit, Spam Diagnostics, and Fail for the nonexistent domain, and Submit, Receive, Spam Diagnostics, and Fail for the nonexistent user.

6. Close the Message Trace window.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have used the Message Header Analyzer to identify why email failed to deliver, used the upport and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 to analyze the mail flow for an email message that (appeared) it was not received, and analyzed mail flow in the Exchange admin center.


## Exercise 2: Monitoring service health and analyzing reports
  
### Scenario
  
You identified the reports that you need to provide to A. Datum's management. Management is particularly interested in the number of malware and spam items that are reaching the organization. You need to familiarize yourself with the Office 365 reporting tools. Your next task is to produce reports on the numbers of messages that Exchange Online Protection is intercepting.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. View Office 365 service health
2. View reports in the Office 365 admin center


#### Task 1: View Office 365 service health
  
1. Connect to the Office 365 admin center.
<<<<<<< HEAD

2. On the menu, access  **Service Health**, and then view the history of the past 30 days for the Exchange Online service.

3. Select any yellow entry in the calendar to see further details.

=======
2. On the menu, access  **Service Health**, and view any existing incidents or advisories.
3. View the history of recent incidents by selecting **View history**.
