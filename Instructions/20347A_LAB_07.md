# Module 7: Planning and configuring Exchange Online services
# Lab A: Configuring message transport in Exchange Online
  
### Scenario
  
The pilot project is going well at A. Datum Corporation. However, before you finish the pilot project and perform a full deployment, you need to confirm that you can configure Exchange Online settings to match the on-premises settings for options such as message transport.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure message transport settings.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Use the lab steps provided by the hosting partner when completing the labs in this course.

### Lab setup
  
Estimated Time: 35 minutes

## Exercise 1: Configuring message-transport settings
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum has several email transport settings configured in their on-premises Exchange environment. You need to ensure that you also can configure the same settings in Exchange Online, including:

- A custom send and receive connector that will enforce TLS when sending email messages to, or receiving them from, a partner organization.
- A transport rule that will apply a disclaimer to all messages sent to external users
- A transport rule that requires moderator approval for all messages sent to the manager distribution list.
- A journal rule that will retain a copy of all messages sent to and from members of the Development department.


You also need to verify that you can track messages sent between users on Office 365 and sent to external users.

1. Create a custom send and receive connector to enforce TLS

2. Create transport rules
